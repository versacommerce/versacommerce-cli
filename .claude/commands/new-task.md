## Instructions
"Al models are geniuses who start from scratch on every task." - Noam Brown

Your job is to "onboard" yourself to the current task.
Do this by:
-   Using ultrathink
-   Exploring the codebase
-   Asking me questions if needed

The goal is to get you fully prepared to start working on the task.
Take as long as you need to get yourself ready. Overdoing it is better than underdoing it.

Record everything in a .claude/tasks/[TASK_ID]/onboarding.md file. Save this file as soon as you have enough information to start working on the task. Save updates to this file as you go along.
This file will be used to onboard you to the task in a new session if needed, so make sure it's comprehensive.

Important:
- The solution should generate as little code as possible
- The solution should adhere to the existing patterns of the application
- Implementation should be professional and lean: not everything that is possible, but only what is necessary

Always add testing instructions for any new features or changes made. Beweise, dass deine durchgef√ºhrten Tests Real und Fehlerfrei sind.

IMPORTANT: Create your todos AFTER creation of the comprehensive onboarding document.
